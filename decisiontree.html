                  <p>  Swimmers prove their absolute proficiency. This level necessitates the physical strength, endurance, and control it takes to be start lifesaving training. Mastery of independent swim is earned by swimming a 300m workout, head-up breaststroke sprints over 25 m, and sprinting a challenge of 50 meters in 90 seconds. Accompanying lifesaving skills challenge and improve our own movement to create effective and strong swimmers for life. Swimmers are encouraged to enrol in the Lifesaving society courses: Patrols for 12 and under and Bronze Medallion for 13 and over after the completion of this level.

                          <h3>Students with Neuro-Diversities and/or Disabilities</h3>
                        <p>  Brave Waves takes pride in offering swimming lessons for children with special considerations.</p>

                        <p>Most swimmers with neuro-diversities and/or disabilities are integrated into our regular semi-private and small group swim programs because of our low instructor/student ratio. Other times, students need some extra consideration.</p>
                    
                  
                          <p>Students that require 1:1 attention or need to have a guardian enter the pool with them will have the ability to book private lessons by calling us at 519-861-9300. A Brave Waves assessment will be necessary for them to qualify for the program. Guardians must be prepared to enter the water for the assessment if the instructors deem it necessary.
